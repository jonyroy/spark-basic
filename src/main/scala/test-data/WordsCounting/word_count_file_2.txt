Repalallize using repartition and coalesce Some times we may need to repartition the RDD
Spark provides two ways to repartition; first using repartition
method which shuffles data from all nodes also called full shuffle and second coalesce
method which shuffle data from minimum nodes for examples if you have data in 4 partitions and doing
coalesce moves data from just 2 nodes.
Both of the functions take the number of partitions to repartition rdd as shown below
Note that repartition method is a very expensive operation as it shuffles data from all nodes in a cluster.
